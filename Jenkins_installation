 Installing Jenkins
Before we can install Jenkins, we have to add the key and source list to apt. This is done in 2 steps, first we'll add the key.

wget -q -O - http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | apt-key add -
Secondly, we'll create a sources list for Jenkins.

echo deb http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list
Now, we only have to update apt's cache before we can install Jenkins.

apt-get update
As the cache has been updated we can proceed installing Jenkins. Note that Jenkins has a big bunch of dependencies, so it might take a few moments to install them all.

apt-get install jenkins
